Hi, my name is Jae and I'm currently a senior at Virgina Tech. For the past years, going to careers 
fairs in search of an internship or a co-op, I've come to the realization that everybody comes with a resume.
So their than, I had to do something to be different that everyone else. By building this website about myself
has give me the freedom tell who I am by not simply from a piece of paper, but through a different perspective.

By looking at me through a website where I used my own imagination and creativity, hopefully it can show more than
what my major is, what my gpa is, and my background experience on the topics that I am stuyding through at school. 
Though my major isn't computer science or web development, I want to show whoever I am introducing myself to something
that I learned completely on my own from bottom up, and really show that I am the type of person and worker that is 
willing to learn something and apply it to my studies and the real world. I'm currently seeking an internship for
the summer of 2018 or a co-op.
