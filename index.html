			Hi, my name is Jae and I'm currently a senior at Virgina Tech. For the past years, going to careers 
			fairs in search of an internship or a co-op, I've come to the realization that everybody comes with a resume.
			So their than, I had to do something to be different that everyone else. By building this website about myself
			has give me the freedom tell who I am by not simply from a piece of paper, but through a different perspective.

			<h1>
			By looking at me through a website where i used my own imagination and creativity, hopefully it can show more than
			what my major is, what my gpa is, and my background experience on the topics that I am stuyding through at school. 
			Though my major isn't computer science or web development, I want to show whoever I am introducing myself to something
			that I learned completely on my own from bottom up, and really show that I am the type of person and worker that is 
			willing to learn something and apply it to my studies and the real world.
